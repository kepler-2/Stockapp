        <string name="privacypolicy_title4">4. Use of Cookies::</string>
        <string name="privacypolicy4">
To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use "cookies", or such
similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a
User Identification (User ID) to understand the User\'s individual interests using the identified
computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), The
Royal Bull has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User\'s
computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the
User. A cookie cannot read data off the User\'s hard drive. The Royal Bull’s advertisers may also
assign their own cookies to the User\'s browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process
that The Royal Bull does not control.
The Royal Bull's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's
connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User's IP
address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the
User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the
User personally. The Royal Bull uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon
request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal and let
advertisers know the geographic locations from where The Royal Bull's visitors come.</string>

The Royal Bull\'s servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location
bar on the User\'s browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the
privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from
The Royal Bull's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link
from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information. The Royal
Bull is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites</string>

        <string name="privacypolicy_title6">Security Procedures:</string>
